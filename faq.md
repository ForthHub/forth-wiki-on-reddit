## Getting Started

### Why Forth?

1. Forth is one of the few environments which is totally comprehensible by one person.
2. Forth has no inherent keywords -- programming is done by extending the language to your application.
   Thus, it can become what ever you need it to be.
   Forth can compile itself into a new compiler!
3. Forth has a "low floor; high ceiling" approach to abstraction -- that is,
   it can be both low level, high level and anywhere inbetween.
4. You can get an application to run in a miniscule amount of RAM.
5. You can try things out interactively in real time as you build your system.
   The compiling functionality is a part of the language like everything else.
6. It can be used to debug itself!
7. It is fast.
