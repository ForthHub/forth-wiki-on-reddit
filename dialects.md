# Dialects of The Forth Language Family

-----------------------------------

# Family Parade

here we present the parade of the forth language family,
leaded by the original forth language,
and his younger brother colorforth;
right follows their functional cousin joy;
and the parade marching on ...

## ANSI forth

  * The 1994 ANSI standard.
    * PDF: http://www.greenarraychips.com/home/documents/dpans94.pdf
    * html: http://forth.sourceforge.net/std/dpans/

There are many implementations of forth
Please visit the [implementations page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Forth/wiki/implementations) to explore.

## colorforth

Colorforth is a newer language and environment by Chuck Moore, creator of the original forth. It introduces many simplifications that break with traditional programming environments. The colorforth primitives are also the 32 core instructions of the multi-computer chips from GreenArrays, Inc.

## joy

Joy is a purely functional high level programming language
which eliminates lambda abstraction and function application
and replaces them by program quotation and function composition.

## factor

Factor is dynamically typed and has automatic memory management, as well as powerful metaprogramming features. The language has a single implementation featuring a self-hosted optimizing compiler and an interactive development environment. The Factor distribution includes a large standard library.

## retro

Retro is designed to be small, easily learned, and easily modified to meet specific needs,
it has been developed and refined through continual use by a small community over more than a decade.
it runs on a highly portable virtual machine called Ngaro.
